Waldo Photos coding exercise

I split this project into 2 pieces.
1. A Java portion that reads the photos, extracts the exif data, and saves the details.
2. An HTML, .js, .css UI to display details for the photos.


To run the Java portion execute the com.waldo.recruiting.Main class. 
This will create a photos.json file containing the exif data.

photos.json will need to be placed in the same folder as the HTML files.

Notes:
- Usually I would have used a database to store the data but I thought a file would be easier to demo.
- A live demo can be viewed at http://www.chrisbentley.us/waldo.
